# ChessEngine
A chess game made in C# with windows forms. Built in two phases, about a year apart. Missing certain features, such as en passent, castling, promotion, and check/stalemate. The structure of the program is generally flawed, as encapsulation is not used properly, meaning that adding these features would likely require a total redesign.
